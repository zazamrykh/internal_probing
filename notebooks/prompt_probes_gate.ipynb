    "This is improvement of linear probing approach. Let's make one more forward pass after generation with trainable prompt embedding, appended to the end of generated sequence. Intuition is simple: it will gather information when bypassing through model's layer. After last layer linear probe will be applied to saturated last hidden state of this additional prompt embedding. Let's call it propagate embedding / propagate residual\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I describe above has drowback. We do not directly saturate our embedding, I propose use gate for writing information to residual streams. Let's do rl+1=rl+gl⊙Fl(rl), for propagate residual. where gl is tranable for each layer. Default variant for that action is rl+1=rl+Fl(rl) just reminder. "
